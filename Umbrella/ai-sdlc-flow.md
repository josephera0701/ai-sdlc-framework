# AI-Driven SDLC Framework

## Core Workflow (Iterative)

**Planning** → **Requirements** → **Design** → **Development** → **Testing** → **Deployment** → **Maintenance**

*With continuous feedback loops and security integration*

### Phase 1: Planning & Initiation
- **Input**: Business opportunity, project vision
- **AI Tasks**: Feasibility analysis, risk assessment, resource estimation
- **Output**: Project charter, initial timeline, stakeholder map
- **Security**: Threat modeling, compliance requirements

### Phase 2: Requirements Analysis
- **Input**: Project charter, initial timeline, stakeholder map, stakeholder needs
- **AI Tasks**: Extract requirements, generate user stories, create acceptance criteria
- **Output**: Requirements specification, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **Security**: Security requirements, privacy considerations
- **Validation**: Stakeholder review and approval

### Phase 3: System Design
- **Input**: Requirements specification, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **AI Tasks**: Generate system architecture, API specs, database schema, UI flows, wireframes, data interfaces
- **Output**: Technical design documents, architecture diagrams, UI flows, wireframes, data interface specs
- **Security**: Security architecture, data protection design
- **Validation**: Design review, architecture validation

### Phase 4: Development (Iterative)
- **Input**: Technical design documents, architecture diagrams
- **AI Tasks**: Code generation, scaffolding, implementation, code review
- **Output**: Working application with unit tests
- **Security**: Secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning
- **Validation**: Code reviews, continuous integration

### Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Input**: Working application, unit tests, technical design documents
- **AI Tasks**: Create test plan, generate test cases, run automated tests, detect bugs
- **Output**: Test plan, test cases, test reports, bug fixes, quality metrics
- **Security**: Security testing, penetration testing
- **Validation**: Test coverage analysis, performance validation

### Phase 6: Deployment & Release
- **Input**: Tested application, test reports, quality metrics
- **AI Tasks**: Configure CI/CD, deploy, monitor
- **Output**: Production deployment, monitoring setup
- **Security**: Security monitoring, access controls
- **Validation**: Deployment verification, rollback procedures

### Phase 7: Maintenance & Evolution
- **Input**: Production deployment, monitoring setup, user feedback
- **AI Tasks**: Monitor performance, analyze issues, suggest improvements
- **Output**: Updates, patches, enhancements
- **Security**: Security updates, threat monitoring
- **Validation**: Impact assessment, change management

## Implementation Approaches

### Waterfall (Simple Projects)
Execute phases sequentially with validation gates

### Agile (Complex Projects)
Iterate through phases in 2-4 week sprints with continuous feedback

### DevOps (Production Systems)
Continuous integration of development, testing, and deployment

## Quick Start

1. **Choose Approach**: Select waterfall, agile, or DevOps based on project complexity
2. **Initialize Planning**: Use AI to assess feasibility and create project charter
3. **Execute Phases**: Run each phase with AI assistance and validation gates
4. **Iterate**: Refine based on feedback and changing requirements

## Key Benefits
- **Speed**: 5-10x faster development cycles
- **Quality**: AI-driven testing, security, and code review
- **Adaptability**: Flexible approach based on project needs
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early validation and continuous feedback
- **Security**: Built-in security throughout the lifecycle
- **Maintainability**: Structured approach to long-term evolution
