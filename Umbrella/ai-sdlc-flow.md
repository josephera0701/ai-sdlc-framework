# AI-SDLC Framework Flow

## Execution Models

### Linear Model (Phases 1-3)
**Planning** → **Requirements** → **Design**
- Sequential execution with validation gates
- Each phase must complete before next begins
- Suitable for establishing project foundation

### Iterative Model (Phases 4-6)
**Development** ⟷ **Testing** ⟷ **Deployment**
- Components flow through phases independently
- Multiple components in different phases simultaneously
- Continuous integration and deployment

### Maintenance Model (Phase 7)
**Monitoring** → **Analysis** → **Enhancement** → **Deployment**
- Continuous improvement cycle
- Based on production feedback and metrics

## Phase Execution

### Phases 1-3: Linear Foundation
1. **Planning**: Project charter, timeline, stakeholders
2. **Requirements**: User stories, acceptance criteria, security requirements
3. **Design**: Architecture, UI flows, wireframes, data interfaces

### Phases 4-6: Iterative Development
**Per Component Cycle:**
- **Develop** component with tests and docs
- **Test** component (unit, integration, security)
- **Deploy** component to staging/production
- **Validate** component performance
- **Repeat** for next component

### Phase 7: Continuous Maintenance
- Monitor production performance
- Analyze user feedback and metrics
- Plan and implement enhancements
- Deploy updates using iterative model

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Initialize project
python Umbrella/1-start-project.py

# Check progress
python Umbrella/2-resume-project.py

# Validate phase completion
python Umbrella/3-validate-phase.py

# Save session
python Umbrella/4-pause-project.py

# Complete project
python Umbrella/5-end-project.py
```

## Key Benefits
- **Linear Foundation**: Solid planning and design before development
- **Iterative Delivery**: Working features deployed incrementally
- **Risk Reduction**: Smaller deployments, faster feedback
- **Parallel Work**: Multiple components in development simultaneously
- **Continuous Value**: Features available as soon as ready
