# Phase 4: Development AI Rules

## MANDATORY INPUTS
- Technical design documents (from Phase 3)
- Architecture diagrams (from Phase 3)

## PROCESSING RULES
1. Generate code following specified framework and standards
2. Implement all features from user stories
3. Include comprehensive error handling
4. Apply secure coding practices
5. Create unit tests for all functions
6. Generate complete documentation

## MANDATORY OUTPUTS
- Working application with unit tests

## VALIDATION CRITERIA
- All user stories are implemented
- Code follows specified standards and best practices
- Error handling covers all identified scenarios
- Security measures are properly implemented
- Unit tests achieve minimum coverage threshold
- Application runs without critical errors

## GENERAL RULES
- Always reference inputs from Phase 3
- Follow specified technology stack and frameworks
- Apply secure coding practices throughout
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Generate unit tests with adequate coverage
- Document all code and configurations
- Prioritize editing existing files over creating new ones
- Remove unnecessary files after each iteration

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
- At session end: Create/update SESSION-STATUS.md with current progress
- At session start: Review SESSION-STATUS.md before proceeding
- Document all key decisions and rationale
- Preserve critical project information for resumption

## FILE ORGANIZATION
- Create `4-Development/` folder before starting
- Create subfolders: `4-Development/src/`, `4-Development/tests/`, `4-Development/docs/`
- Place source code in `src/` subfolder
- Place unit tests in `tests/` subfolder
- Place documentation in `docs/` subfolder
- Reference Phase 3 files using: `../3-Design/[filename]`
- Verify folder structure before completing phase
